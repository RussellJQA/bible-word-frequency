### Simple Freq (Simple Relative Frequency)

In Psalm 23, the words "anointest" and "to" both occur 1 time. This is the only occurrence of "anointest" in the entire KJV Bible. But the word "to" occurs 13,630 times, including this one.

So, it's more noteworthy that "anointest" occurs in Psalm 23 than that "to" occurs there. That's why we assign it a higher Simple Relative Frequency:

- anointest: 790,663 * (1/1)     = 790,663
- to:        790,663 * (1/13360) = 58.01

| Word	    | In chapter |	In KJV | Simple Freq |
|:----------|-----------:|--------:|------------:|
| anointest |          1 |       1 |     790,663 |
| to	    |          1 | 	13,630 |	   58.01 |

### Weighted Freq (Weighted Relative Frequency)

#### Example 1

The word "merciful" occurs 40 times in the KJV, including 1 time in Deuteronomy 4 and 1 time in Psalm 117. So for both those chapters, the Simple Relative Frequency of "merciful" is the same:

- merciful: 790,663 * (1/40) = 19,767

Deuteronomy 4 has a total of 1,503 words, but Psalm 117 only has 33 words. So, it's more noteworthy that "merciful" is among Psalm 117's 33 words than that it's among Deuteronmy 4's 1,503 words. That's why we assign it a higher Weighted Relative Frequency:

- Deu 4:   merciful: (19,767/ 1,503) + (1-1) = 13.15
- Psa 117: merciful: (19,767 /   33) + (1-1) = 599

| Chapter | Word      | In chapter |  In KJV | Simple Freq | Weighted Freq |
|:------- |:----------|-----------:|--------:|------------:|--------------:|
| Deu 4   | merciful  |          1 |       1 |      19,757 |           599 |
| Psa 117 | merciful  |          1 |      40 |      19,757 |         13.15 |

#### Example 2

Genesis 4 contains 8 of the KJV's 16 occurrences of "abel", and 1 of the 2 occurrences of "artificer". (For frequency calculations, all words are lowercased.) Both have the same Simple Relative Frequency:

- abel: 790,663 * (8/16) = 395,332
- artificer: 790,663 * (1/2) = 395,332

And since they're both in the chapter, they would also have the same Weighted Relative Frequency if that was calculated simply as:

    Simple Relative Frequency / Total number of words in the chapter
    395,332 / 632 = 625.5

That's why we add the number of occurrences of the specified word in the chapter (minus 1):

- abel: 625.5 + (8-1) = 632.5
- artificer: 625.5 + (1-1) = 625.5
