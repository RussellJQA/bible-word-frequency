	This Web site provides information about how often each word occurs in the <a href="https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-kjv_readaloud.zip">(KJV) Bible<a>.
</p>
<p>
	For each chapter in the Bible, there is a separate, corresponding Web page.
</p>
<p>
	Each of those Web pages displays a sortable table with 5 columns of information for each word in that chapter:
	<ol>
		<li>Word: the word</li>
		<li>In chapter: The number of times that word occurs in that Bible chapter</li>
		<li>In KJV: The number of times that word occurs in the entire Bible</li>
		<li>Simple Freq: The simple, unweighted relative frequency of that word in this chapter, which is calculated as:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>the total number of words in the Bible multiplied by the quotient of:</li>
				<li><ul>
					<li>In chapter (2nd column): The number of times that word occurs in that Bible chapter</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>divided by:</li>
				<li><ul>
					<li>In KJV (3rd column): The number of times that word occurs in the entire Bible</li>
				</ul></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Weighted Freq: The weighted relative frequency of that word in this chapter:<br>

				</ul></li>
				<li>and [In chapter (2nd column) - 1]
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	Each page also links to a downloadable .csv file containing the same information.
